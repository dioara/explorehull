When Hull was announced as the UK City of Culture 2017 in November 2013, many outside Yorkshire were surprised. This was a city more often associated with industrial decline than cultural vibrancy, a place that had long struggled with its image. Four years later, Hull would prove the doubters spectacularly wrong, delivering a year of culture that not only exceeded expectations but fundamentally changed how the city saw itself—and how the world saw Hull.

## The Announcement: A City Transformed

The journey to becoming City of Culture began with a bold application that emphasized Hull's unique character, its maritime heritage, and its determination to write a new chapter in its story. When the announcement came in 2013, it sparked something remarkable: a surge of civic pride and collective ambition that would carry through the preparation years and into 2017 itself.

The designation brought immediate benefits. Hull gained access to significant funding to improve its cultural infrastructure and arts facilities. More importantly, it provided a framework for the city to showcase its creativity, celebrate its heritage, and demonstrate its potential. A £32 million investment was raised to deliver an ambitious program that would span the entire year.

## A Year Like No Other: The 2017 Program

The scale of Hull's City of Culture year was breathtaking. Over 365 days, the city delivered more than 2,800 events, exhibitions, installations, and cultural activities. These ranged from intimate community projects to spectacular large-scale productions that captured international attention.

The year opened with "Made in Hull," a stunning outdoor spectacle that saw thousands of residents parade through the city streets, celebrating Hull's industrial heritage and creative spirit. This set the tone for a year that would consistently surprise and delight, blending professional productions with community participation in ways that made culture accessible to all.

Major highlights included the Freedom Festival, which grew into one of Europe's largest free outdoor arts festivals, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors. The Amy Johnson Festival celebrated Hull's pioneering aviator with events across the city. Blade, a spectacular installation by Japanese artist Nayan Shrimali, transformed Queen Victoria Square with thousands of illuminated wind spinners, creating a mesmerizing tribute to Hull's maritime and industrial heritage.

The cultural program was deliberately diverse, encompassing everything from classical music and opera to street art and electronic music. The Humber Street Sesh music festival showcased local and national talent. The Humber Mouth Literature Festival brought renowned authors to the city. Hull Independent Cinema expanded access to world cinema. Each event contributed to a tapestry of cultural activity that seemed to touch every corner of the city.

## The Numbers Tell a Story

The impact of Hull 2017 can be measured in multiple ways, but the statistics are striking. More than five million people attended events throughout the year—a remarkable figure for a city of approximately 260,000 residents. This included 1.3 million additional visitors compared to 2013, representing a significant boost to Hull's tourism sector.

The economic impact was substantial. Tourism value in 2017 was projected to reach record levels, with visitors spending an estimated £25.2 million. The cultural program itself created employment opportunities, with hundreds of artists, technicians, and support staff working on events throughout the year.

Perhaps more significantly, Hull's museums and cultural venues saw unprecedented visitor numbers. The Ferens Art Gallery, which underwent a major refurbishment ahead of 2017, attracted record crowds. The Hull Maritime Museum, Streetlife Museum, and Wilberforce House all benefited from increased interest in the city's heritage and culture.

## Beyond the Events: Cultural Transformation

The true measure of Hull 2017's success goes beyond visitor numbers and economic impact. The year catalyzed a cultural transformation that has proven remarkably durable. Research conducted by the University of Hull found that the program brought "profound but somewhat fragile" changes to Hull's economy, community, and cultural sector.

One of the most significant impacts was on civic pride and identity. For decades, Hull had struggled with a negative self-image, often ranking poorly in surveys of city perceptions. The City of Culture year gave residents permission to celebrate their city, to take pride in its unique character and heritage. This psychological shift has proven lasting, with subsequent surveys showing sustained improvements in how residents view their city.

The cultural sector itself was transformed. New organizations emerged, existing ones expanded, and a generation of artists and cultural workers gained experience and confidence. The year demonstrated that Hull could deliver world-class cultural events, attracting talent and investment that might previously have bypassed the city.

## The Legacy Plan: Sustaining Momentum

Even before 2017 ended, Hull City Council was planning for the future. In September 2017, the council confirmed a £250 million legacy plan designed to sustain and build upon the momentum generated by the City of Culture year. This ambitious program included major infrastructure investments and new cultural attractions.

Central to the legacy plan was the creation of a major new maritime heritage attraction, funded by £27 million of investment. This project aimed to capitalize on Hull's unique seafaring history, creating a destination that would continue to attract visitors long after 2017 ended.

The plan also included continued investment in Hull's museums and galleries, improvements to public spaces, and support for the cultural sector. The goal was not simply to preserve what had been achieved in 2017, but to use it as a foundation for ongoing cultural and economic development.

## Lasting Changes: Hull Today

More than seven years after the City of Culture year, evidence of its lasting impact can be seen throughout Hull. The city's cultural calendar remains vibrant, with many of the festivals and events launched or expanded in 2017 continuing as annual fixtures. The Freedom Festival, in particular, has become an established highlight of Hull's summer, maintaining the spirit of accessible, high-quality outdoor arts.

Hull's museums continue to thrive, with visitor numbers remaining significantly higher than pre-2017 levels. In 2023-24, over 383,000 people visited the city's free museums and galleries—13% higher than in 2019-20 and far exceeding pre-2017 figures. This sustained interest demonstrates that the City of Culture year succeeded in fundamentally changing perceptions of Hull as a cultural destination.

The physical transformation of the city continues. The Fruit Market area, once derelict, has been transformed into a thriving cultural quarter, home to artists' studios, galleries, and creative businesses. The Hull Marina area has seen significant development, with new restaurants, bars, and residential properties capitalizing on the waterfront location.

Perhaps most importantly, the cultural confidence gained in 2017 has endured. Hull continues to punch above its weight culturally, attracting events, exhibitions, and performances that might once have been considered beyond the city's reach. The success of 2017 proved that Hull could deliver, and that confidence has become self-fulfilling.

## Challenges and Ongoing Work

The legacy of Hull 2017 is not without challenges. Research has noted that while the changes brought by the City of Culture year were profound, they remain "somewhat fragile." Sustaining cultural programming requires ongoing investment and commitment, particularly in an era of constrained public finances.

There are also questions about how evenly the benefits of 2017 have been distributed across the city. While some areas, particularly the city center and waterfront, have seen dramatic transformation, other communities have seen less tangible change. Ensuring that the cultural legacy reaches all of Hull's residents remains an ongoing challenge.

The economic transformation, too, has been uneven. While tourism and the cultural sector have grown, Hull continues to face broader economic challenges. The City of Culture year was never going to solve all of the city's problems, but it has provided tools and confidence that can contribute to ongoing regeneration efforts.

## A Model for Others

Hull's experience as City of Culture has become a case study for other cities considering similar initiatives. The program demonstrated that cultural investment can catalyze broader change, improving perceptions, building confidence, and creating new opportunities. The emphasis on community participation and accessibility set a standard that subsequent Cities of Culture have sought to emulate.

The key lessons from Hull 2017 include the importance of genuine community engagement, the value of taking risks with programming, and the need for sustained commitment beyond the designated year. Hull showed that a City of Culture year works best when it amplifies and celebrates what makes a place unique, rather than trying to impose a generic cultural template.

## Looking Forward

As Hull continues to build on the foundation laid in 2017, the city faces both opportunities and challenges. The cultural sector remains vibrant, but requires ongoing support to thrive. The physical transformation of the city continues, but needs to reach beyond the city center. The confidence and pride generated in 2017 persist, but must be nurtured and renewed.

What is clear is that Hull 2017 succeeded in its fundamental goal: changing the story of Hull. This is no longer a city defined solely by industrial decline or economic challenges. It is a place with a rich cultural life, a proud heritage, and a confidence in its own potential. The year of culture didn't solve all of Hull's problems, but it gave the city something invaluable: a new sense of what it could be.

For visitors to Hull today, the legacy of 2017 is evident everywhere—in the vibrant cultural calendar, the transformed public spaces, the thriving museums and galleries, and perhaps most of all, in the pride and welcome they'll encounter from Hull's residents. The City of Culture year may have ended, but its spirit continues to shape this remarkable city.
