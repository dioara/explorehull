Hull may not be the first English city that comes to mind when planning a UK trip, but this Yorkshire port has quietly transformed into one of the country's most rewarding destinations. With over 800 years of maritime history, world-class free museums, stunning architecture, and a vibrant cultural scene, Hull offers far more than many visitors expect. Whether you're interested in history, art, marine life, or simply soaking up the atmosphere of an authentic English city, these ten attractions should top your Hull itinerary.

## 1. The Deep: Journey into the Ocean's Depths

No visit to Hull is complete without experiencing The Deep, one of the world's most spectacular aquariums. This striking building, designed by Sir Terry Farrell, rises dramatically from the banks of the Humber like a giant glass shard, its architecture alone worth the visit.

Inside, The Deep takes you on a journey from the origins of life in the oceans through to the present day. The centerpiece is a massive 10-meter-deep tank holding 2.5 million liters of water, home to sharks, rays, and thousands of fish. Walking through the underwater tunnel, with marine life swimming overhead and around you, is genuinely awe-inspiring.

What sets The Deep apart is its commitment to education and conservation. Interactive exhibits explain ocean ecosystems, the impact of climate change on marine life, and ongoing conservation efforts. The touch pools allow hands-on encounters with starfish and crabs, while the Lagoon of Light showcases the mesmerizing beauty of jellyfish.

## 2. Ferens Art Gallery: World-Class Art in a Victorian Gem

The Ferens Art Gallery is Hull's crown jewel of visual arts, and remarkably, it's completely free to enter. Housed in a beautiful Victorian building on Queen Victoria Square, the Ferens underwent a major £4.5 million refurbishment ahead of Hull's City of Culture year and emerged as one of the finest regional art galleries in Britain.

The permanent collection spans seven centuries, from Old Masters to contemporary art. Highlights include works by Frans Hals, Canaletto, and David Hockney, whose connections to East Yorkshire make his presence here particularly appropriate. The gallery also holds an impressive collection of marine paintings, reflecting Hull's maritime heritage.

The Ferens gained national attention during City of Culture 2017 when it hosted the Turner Prize, bringing contemporary art's most prestigious award to Hull for the first time. Since then, the gallery has maintained an ambitious program of temporary exhibitions, often featuring works on loan from national collections.

## 3. Hull's Old Town: Medieval Streets and Hidden Corners

Hull's Old Town is where the city's story began, and wandering its medieval streets offers a journey through eight centuries of history. This compact area, roughly bounded by the River Hull and the old town walls, contains the highest concentration of historic buildings in the city.

Start at the Hull Minster (Holy Trinity Church), one of the largest parish churches in England. This magnificent building, dating from the 14th century, features stunning medieval brickwork and beautiful stained glass. The interior is surprisingly spacious, with soaring columns and intricate carved details.

From there, explore the narrow lanes and alleys that branch off from the main streets. High Street, Lowgate, and Scale Lane contain a fascinating mix of medieval, Georgian, and Victorian architecture. Look for the Museum Quarter, where four of Hull's museums cluster together in historic buildings.

Don't miss the Old Town's hidden gems: the Minerva pub, Hull's oldest, sitting right on the waterfront; the charming cobbled Trinity Market with its independent traders; and the Paragon Arcade, a beautiful Victorian shopping arcade that feels like stepping back in time.

- **Opening Hours:** Always accessible (individual buildings have varying hours)  
- **Admission:** Free to explore

## 4. Streetlife Museum: Transport Through the Ages

The Streetlife Museum offers something genuinely special: a chance to walk through recreated Victorian and Edwardian streets, complete with authentic shop fronts, cobblestones, and period vehicles. This free museum brings Hull's transport history to life in an immersive and engaging way.

The museum's collection includes everything from horse-drawn carriages to vintage cars, trams to bicycles. You can climb aboard many of the vehicles, making it particularly popular with children. The recreated streets are populated with mannequins in period costume, creating atmospheric scenes of daily life in Hull's past.

Highlights include a 1940s street scene complete with an air raid shelter, vintage advertising signs, and shop displays that showcase how dramatically retail has changed. The carriage collection is particularly impressive, ranging from elegant private carriages to working vehicles used by tradesmen.

## 5. Wilberforce House: Confronting the Slavery Legacy

William Wilberforce, the parliamentarian who led the campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, was born in Hull in 1759. His childhood home is now a museum dedicated to his life, the abolition movement, and the broader history of slavery and its legacies.

Wilberforce House is a beautiful 17th-century merchant's house, and the building itself is worth seeing. But the museum's importance goes far beyond architecture. The exhibitions confront difficult truths about Britain's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, explain the long campaign for abolition, and explore how slavery's legacies persist today.

The museum has been recently updated with new galleries that use personal stories, artifacts, and multimedia presentations to bring this history to life. It's a thought-provoking and sometimes challenging visit, but an important one that provides crucial context for understanding British history.

**Practical Information:**

- **Opening Hours:** Tuesday-Saturday 10am-4:30pm, Sunday 11am-4pm, Closed Mondays

## 6. Hull Maritime Museum: Eight Centuries of Seafaring

Housed in the former Dock Offices, a grand Victorian building on Queen Victoria Square, the Hull Maritime Museum tells the story of Hull's relationship with the sea. Given that maritime industries defined Hull for centuries, this museum is essential for understanding the city.

The collections cover whaling, fishing, and merchant shipping. The whaling galleries are particularly striking, with massive whale skeletons, harpoons, and scrimshaw (carved whale bone) illustrating this dangerous and ultimately destructive industry. The fishing galleries honor the trawlermen who worked in some of the world's most dangerous waters, many never returning home.

Ship models fill the museum, ranging from medieval cogs to modern container ships, showing how maritime technology evolved. Interactive displays explain navigation, shipbuilding, and life at sea. The museum also examines Hull's role in naval history, including its importance during both World Wars.

## 7. Arctic Corsair: Step Aboard a Deep-Sea Trawler

Moored in the River Hull near the Fruit Market, the Arctic Corsair is one of the last surviving deep-sea trawlers from Hull's once-mighty fishing fleet. This museum ship offers a rare opportunity to experience what life was like for the trawlermen who worked in some of the world's most dangerous waters.

Built in 1960, the Arctic Corsair worked the distant waters off Iceland and in the Barents Sea until 1987. Climbing aboard, you can explore the bridge, engine room, fish hold, and crew quarters. The cramped conditions, basic facilities, and industrial equipment give a vivid sense of how tough life at sea was.

Guided tours (when available) bring the ship to life with stories of life aboard, the dangers faced, and the Cod Wars with Iceland. The Arctic Corsair serves as a memorial to the many Hull trawlermen who lost their lives at sea, making it a poignant as well as educational visit.

**Practical Information:**  
- **Location:** Hull Marina, HU1 2DW  
- **Opening Hours:** Seasonal and weather-dependent; check website before visiting  
- **Admission:** Free  
- **Time Needed:** 45 minutes to 1 hour

## 8. Hull Marina: Waterfront Transformation

Hull Marina represents the city's successful transformation from industrial port to modern waterfront destination. Created from former dock basins, the marina is now lined with restaurants, bars, apartments, and the Hull Truck Theatre, creating a vibrant area that's particularly lively on summer evenings.

The marina is perfect for a leisurely stroll, with paths along the water offering views of moored yachts and the Humber beyond. Several floating museum ships are moored here, including the Arctic Corsair and the Spurn Lightship, a recently refurbished floating lighthouse that offers self-guided tours.

The area around the marina has become Hull's dining hub, with options ranging from casual cafes to upscale restaurants. On sunny days, the outdoor terraces fill with people enjoying the waterfront atmosphere. The marina also hosts events throughout the year, from boat shows to outdoor concerts.

## 9. East Park: Victorian Green Space

When you need a break from museums and historic buildings, East Park offers 120 acres of Victorian parkland just northeast of the city center. Created in 1887, this beautifully maintained park provides a green oasis with something for everyone.

The park's centerpiece is a large ornamental lake where you can rent rowboats in summer. The animal education center houses various small animals and is particularly popular with children. Formal gardens showcase seasonal displays, while wooded areas offer peaceful walks.

East Park also features a splash boat ride, crazy golf, and a cafe. The park hosts events throughout the year, including outdoor theater in summer and a spectacular bonfire night display. It's a favorite spot for Hull families and offers visitors a glimpse of everyday life in the city.

## 10. The Fruit Market: Creative Quarter

The Fruit Market area, once derelict warehouses and industrial buildings, has been transformed into Hull's creative quarter. This compact neighborhood near the marina is home to artists' studios, independent galleries, quirky shops, and some of Hull's most interesting bars and restaurants.

The transformation accelerated during Hull's City of Culture year and continues today. Former fruit warehouses now house creative businesses, while new developments have added residential and commercial spaces. The result is a neighborhood that feels genuinely creative and slightly bohemian, a contrast to the more polished marina area.

Highlights include Humber Street, the area's main drag, which hosts the annual Humber Street Sesh music festival. Independent galleries like Humber Street Gallery showcase contemporary art. The Trinity Market, nearby, offers vintage finds and local crafts. For food and drink, options range from artisan coffee shops to craft beer bars.

## Planning Your Visit

These ten attractions offer a comprehensive introduction to Hull, covering its maritime heritage, cultural offerings, and modern transformation. Most are free or inexpensive, making Hull an excellent value destination. The compact city center means you can easily visit several attractions in a day, though Hull deserves at least a weekend to fully appreciate.

The best approach is to combine indoor attractions (museums, galleries) with outdoor experiences (Old Town walks, marina strolls, parks). This provides variety and allows you to adjust your plans based on weather. Many attractions cluster together—the Museums Quarter puts four free museums within a few minutes' walk—making it easy to see multiple sites efficiently.

Hull's story is one of transformation, from medieval port to industrial powerhouse to modern cultural city. These attractions tell that story, offering insights into the past while celebrating the present. First-time visitors often arrive with modest expectations and leave genuinely impressed.
