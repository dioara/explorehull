Hull's events calendar has transformed dramatically in recent years, evolving from a relatively quiet schedule to a year-round program of festivals, cultural events, and celebrations. The City of Culture year in 2017 catalyzed this change, introducing new events and expanding existing ones. Today, Hull offers something happening almost every month, from major festivals attracting tens of thousands to intimate cultural gatherings. Whether you're planning a visit or living locally, here's what to expect throughout the Hull year.

## Spring: Awakening and Renewal

**March-April: Easter Events**

Spring in Hull brings the city back to life after winter. Easter weekend typically features family-friendly events across the city's parks and attractions. East Park hosts Easter egg hunts and activities, while The Deep offers special Easter-themed educational programs. The Hull Museums Quarter often runs Easter workshops for children, combining fun with learning about Hull's heritage.

**April-May: Larkin Out Festival**

The Larkin Out Festival celebrates Hull's most famous literary son, Philip Larkin, who worked as librarian at the University of Hull for 30 years. This poetry and literature festival brings together established and emerging poets, writers, and performers for readings, workshops, and discussions. Events take place across various Hull venues, from the university to city center locations.

While focused on poetry, Larkin Out has broadened its scope to include music, visual arts, and performance, reflecting Larkin's own wide-ranging interests. It's accessible and welcoming, aiming to make poetry relevant and engaging rather than intimidating. For literature lovers, it's a highlight of Hull's cultural calendar.

## Summer: Festivals and Outdoor Events

**June: Humber Street Sesh**

The Humber Street Sesh has become one of Hull's most popular music events, transforming the Fruit Market area into a massive outdoor music venue. This free festival showcases local and national talent across multiple stages, with genres ranging from indie rock to electronic music to hip-hop.

What makes Humber Street Sesh special is its accessibility and community feel. It's free to attend, family-friendly during the day, and showcases Hull's vibrant music scene alongside bigger names. The festival takes advantage of the Fruit Market's unique urban landscape, with stages in courtyards, warehouses, and outdoor spaces creating an intimate festival atmosphere despite the large crowds.

Thousands attend each year, and the festival has become a fixture of Hull's summer, demonstrating the city's musical talent and cultural confidence. Local venues and bars in the area extend their offerings, creating a festival atmosphere that spills beyond the official stages.

**July: Hull Fair (Preview Events)**

While Hull Fair itself happens in October, preview events and preparations begin in summer. The anticipation builds throughout the city as Europe's largest traveling funfair prepares for its annual visit.

**August: Freedom Festival**

Freedom Festival is Hull's flagship cultural event, a three-day celebration of outdoor arts that has grown into one of Europe's largest free outdoor arts festivals. Taking place over the August bank holiday weekend, the festival attracts over 200,000 visitors and features an eclectic mix of street theatre, circus, music, dance, visual arts, and performance.

The festival transforms Hull's city center into a massive outdoor performance space. Queen Victoria Square, Queens Gardens, and surrounding streets host stages, installations, and performances throughout the weekend. The program is deliberately diverse, ranging from large-scale spectacles to intimate performances, from established international artists to emerging local talent.

Highlights typically include a choreographed procession featuring hundreds of dancers and community participants, large-scale visual installations, circus performances, and live music across multiple stages. The festival is family-friendly, with dedicated children's areas and performances, but offers plenty to engage adults as well.

Freedom Festival embodies the spirit that emerged during Hull's City of Culture year—ambitious, accessible, and proud. It's free to attend, welcoming to all, and showcases what makes Hull special: creativity, community, and a determination to punch above its weight culturally.

## Autumn: Tradition and Celebration

**September: Heritage Open Days**

Heritage Open Days is a national initiative, but Hull participates enthusiastically, opening buildings and sites that are normally closed to the public. This is a rare opportunity to explore Hull's architectural and historical treasures, from Victorian civic buildings to historic churches to industrial heritage sites.

Guided tours, talks, and special exhibitions accompany the building openings, providing context and stories behind Hull's heritage. It's an excellent opportunity for both visitors and residents to discover aspects of Hull's history that are usually inaccessible.

**October: Hull Fair**

Hull Fair is an institution, Europe's largest traveling funfair and a tradition that dates back to 1278. For one week in October, Walton Street transforms into a massive fairground, with rides, stalls, and attractions stretching for nearly a mile.

Hull Fair is more than just a funfair—it's a cultural phenomenon that defines autumn in Hull. The city essentially shuts down for the week, with schools giving students time off and businesses adjusting schedules. Generations of Hull families have their Hull Fair traditions, from favorite rides to traditional fair food like brandy snap and toffee apples.

The atmosphere is electric, with the sounds, lights, and smells of the fair filling the area. Modern thrill rides sit alongside traditional attractions, and the fair attracts visitors from across Yorkshire and beyond. For Hull residents, attending Hull Fair is non-negotiable—it's simply what you do in October.

**October-November: Hull Comedy Festival**

Hull's comedy scene has grown significantly, and the Hull Comedy Festival showcases both established comedians and emerging talent. Events take place across various venues, from dedicated comedy clubs to theatres to pubs, making comedy accessible throughout the city.

The festival has helped establish Hull as a stop on the national comedy circuit, attracting bigger names while continuing to support local comedians. It's a mix of stand-up, improv, and alternative comedy, offering something for different tastes.

## Winter: Lights and Celebration

**November: Bonfire Night**

Hull celebrates Bonfire Night with fireworks displays across the city. East Park typically hosts one of the largest displays, with thousands gathering for fireworks, fairground rides, and food stalls. Other displays happen in parks and communities across Hull, creating a city-wide celebration.

**November-December: Christmas Markets and Events**

Hull's Christmas season features markets, lights, and festive events throughout the city center. The Hull Minster Indoor Christmas Market brings craft stalls and festive atmosphere to the historic church. Queen Victoria Square hosts outdoor markets and a Christmas tree, while shops and businesses decorate the city center.

The switching-on of Christmas lights is a major event, typically featuring entertainment and attracting large crowds. Throughout December, Christmas-themed events happen across Hull's venues, from pantomimes at the theatres to special exhibitions at museums.

**December: New Year's Eve**

Hull celebrates New Year's Eve with events across the city. The Marina area becomes a focal point, with bars and restaurants offering special menus and entertainment. Some years feature organized outdoor celebrations with fireworks, though this varies.

## Year-Round: Ongoing Programs

Beyond these major annual events, Hull maintains a year-round cultural calendar. The Hull Truck Theatre and Hull New Theatre present regular programs of drama, musicals, and performances. The Ferens Art Gallery and other museums host changing exhibitions. Live music venues like The Welly Club and The Polar Bear present gigs most weekends.

The Hull Museums Quarter offers free admission year-round, with special exhibitions and events throughout the year. The Deep runs educational programs and special events beyond its regular aquarium operations.

Hull's events calendar means there's rarely a bad time to visit, but certain periods offer particularly rich experiences. The Freedom Festival in August is the obvious highlight, transforming the city for a weekend. Hull Fair in October offers a unique cultural experience you won't find elsewhere.
