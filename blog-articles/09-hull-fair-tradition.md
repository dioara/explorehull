For one week every October, Hull transforms. Walton Street becomes a nearly mile-long fairground, filled with rides, stalls, lights, and the sounds of Europe's largest traveling funfair. Hull Fair is more than just an event—it's a tradition that dates back over 700 years, a cultural phenomenon that defines autumn in Hull, and an experience that brings together generations of families in shared celebration. Understanding Hull Fair is essential to understanding Hull itself.

## A 700-Year Tradition

Hull Fair's origins trace back to 1278, when King Edward I granted Hull a charter to hold an annual fair. For centuries, this was primarily a trading fair, where merchants gathered to buy and sell goods. Over time, entertainment elements were added—performers, games, food stalls—gradually transforming the fair from a commercial event to a celebration.

The modern Hull Fair emerged in the Victorian era, when traveling showmen began bringing mechanical rides and attractions. The fair moved to its current location on Walton Street in the early 20th century, and has remained there ever since, growing larger and more elaborate with each passing decade.

Today, Hull Fair retains its charter dating back over 700 years, making it one of Europe's oldest fairs. But it's also thoroughly modern, featuring cutting-edge rides and attractions that showcase the latest in fairground technology. This combination of ancient tradition and contemporary entertainment is part of what makes Hull Fair special.

## The Scale and Spectacle

The numbers associated with Hull Fair are staggering. The fair stretches for nearly a mile along Walton Street, with over 200 attractions including rides, games, and food stalls. It attracts approximately 1.5 million visitors during its week-long run—remarkable considering Hull's population is around 260,000. People travel from across Yorkshire and beyond to experience Hull Fair.

The fair operates from early afternoon until late evening, with peak times on Friday and Saturday nights when the crowds are at their densest. The atmosphere during these peak times is electric—thousands of people moving between rides, the sounds of music and machinery mixing with screams and laughter, the smell of fried food and candy floss filling the air, and the lights creating a spectacle visible from across the city.

Modern thrill rides dominate the skyline—massive structures that flip, spin, and drop riders at stomach-churning speeds. Names like "Extreme," "Vortex," and "Predator" promise adrenaline, and they deliver. These rides represent significant investments by showmen, who compete to bring the newest and most exciting attractions to Hull Fair.

But alongside the modern thrill rides are traditional attractions that have been part of Hull Fair for generations. The waltzers, dodgems, and carousel remain popular, offering experiences that connect today's fairgoers with their parents and grandparents who rode the same types of attractions decades ago.

## A Hull Institution

What sets Hull Fair apart from other fairs is its significance to Hull's identity. This isn't just an event that happens to take place in Hull—it's a Hull institution that the entire city revolves around for a week.

Schools traditionally give students time off during Hull Fair week, acknowledging that attendance would be poor anyway as families prioritize the fair. Many businesses adjust their schedules, and the city's rhythm changes. For that week, Hull Fair is the center of Hull life.

Generations of Hull families have their Hull Fair traditions. Certain families always go on opening night, others prefer quieter weekday afternoons. Favorite rides are passed down through generations—grandparents who rode the waltzers in the 1960s bring grandchildren to ride them today. Traditional fair foods like brandy snap, toffee apples, and mushy peas are consumed in vast quantities, part of the Hull Fair experience as much as the rides themselves.

For many Hull residents, Hull Fair marks the passage of time. Years are remembered in relation to Hull Fair—"that was the year it rained all week," or "that was the year they had that massive new ride." Children grow up measuring their height against which rides they're finally tall enough to go on. Teenagers gain independence by being allowed to go to the fair with friends rather than parents. Young couples go on dates at the fair. Families bring new babies to experience their first Hull Fair.

## The Showmen's Community

Hull Fair is operated by traveling showmen, families who have been in the fairground business for generations. These aren't casual operators—they're professionals who invest millions in rides and attractions, traveling the country throughout the year but always returning to Hull for the fair.

The showmen's community has its own culture and traditions, with families specializing in particular types of attractions. Some families are known for their thrill rides, others for traditional attractions, still others for games or food stalls. Reputations are built over generations, and the best showmen take pride in their craft.

For the showmen, Hull Fair is the highlight of their year. The size of the event, the loyal crowds, and the week-long run make it economically significant. But there's also pride in being part of such a historic event, in maintaining traditions that stretch back generations, and in providing entertainment that brings joy to millions.

## The Experience

Experiencing Hull Fair is overwhelming, especially for first-timers. The sheer scale, the crowds, the noise, the lights—it's sensory overload in the best possible way. Here's what to expect:

**The Rides:** From gentle attractions suitable for young children to extreme thrill rides that challenge even the bravest, Hull Fair offers rides for all levels. The waltzers remain a classic—spinning cars that whirl around a undulating track, with operators adding extra spins for those who want them. The dodgems (bumper cars) are perennially popular, offering the simple pleasure of crashing into friends and strangers. Modern thrill rides like the "Extreme" and "Vortex" provide intense experiences that leave riders breathless and exhilarated.

**The Games:** Traditional fairground games line the fair—hook-a-duck, shooting galleries, coconut shy, and various skill games offering prizes from small toys to massive stuffed animals. The games are part of the Hull Fair tradition, even if winning is notoriously difficult.

**The Food:** Hull Fair food is its own category of cuisine. Brandy snap—thin, crispy wafers rolled into tubes—is a Hull Fair essential. Toffee apples, candy floss, and doughnuts provide sugar rushes. Mushy peas (yes, at a fair) are a Hull tradition. Burgers, hot dogs, and chips provide more substantial sustenance. The food is unhealthy, overpriced, and absolutely essential to the Hull Fair experience.

**The Atmosphere:** What makes Hull Fair special isn't just the individual elements but the overall atmosphere. The mix of excitement and tradition, the multigenerational crowds, the sense of shared experience—it creates something unique. Hull Fair is where the entire city comes together, where social divisions dissolve in shared enjoyment, where Hull's community spirit is most visible.

## Practical Considerations

Hull Fair is crowded, noisy, and can be overwhelming. Here are some tips for making the most of it:

- **Timing:** Weekday afternoons are quieter than evenings and weekends. Friday and Saturday nights are the busiest, with the largest crowds and longest queues.
- **Budget:** Hull Fair is expensive. Rides typically cost £3-5 each, with the biggest thrill rides costing more. Food and games add up quickly. Budget accordingly.
- **Safety:** The fair is generally safe, with professional operators and regular safety inspections. However, crowds can be dense, so keep track of children and belongings.
- **Weather:** Hull Fair happens regardless of weather. Rain makes the experience less pleasant but doesn't stop the fair. Dress appropriately.
- **Parking:** Parking near the fair is difficult. Public transport or walking from further away is recommended.
