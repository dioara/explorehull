## The Old Town: Where Hull Began

The Old Town is where Hull's story starts, the medieval core around which the modern city grew. Walking these streets means walking through 700 years of history, with buildings spanning from medieval to Victorian sitting alongside contemporary developments.

**Character and Atmosphere**

The Old Town retains its medieval street pattern, with narrow lanes and unexpected courtyards creating an intimate, walkable environment. Many buildings are listed, protected for their historical significance, giving the area an authentic historic character that hasn't been sanitized or theme-parked.

This is a living neighborhood, not a museum. Alongside the historic pubs and museums are modern apartments, offices, and businesses. The mix of old and new, historic and contemporary, gives the Old Town a unique character—respectful of its past but not trapped in it.

**What You'll Find**

**Ye Olde White Harte** is Hull's most historic pub, where the English Civil War was allegedly plotted. The building dates from 1550, with oak beams, creaking floors, and an atmosphere thick with history. It's still a working pub, serving real ale and traditional pub food.

**The George Hotel** is another historic pub, with connections to the abolitionist movement. William Wilberforce, Hull's most famous son, had connections to this establishment. The pub maintains its historic character while serving modern customers.

**Museums** cluster in the Old Town. Wilberforce House, birthplace of William Wilberforce, is now a museum dedicated to the abolitionist movement and Hull's role in the slave trade. The Arctic Corsair, a preserved deep-sea trawler, sits in the nearby dock, offering tours that bring Hull's fishing heritage to life.

**The Minster** (Holy Trinity Church) dominates the Old Town skyline. This is one of England's largest parish churches, with beautiful medieval architecture and a fascinating history. It's free to enter and worth exploring.

**Verdict:** The Old Town is essential for history lovers and anyone wanting to understand Hull's origins. It's atmospheric, walkable, and packed with historic interest. Evenings can be quiet outside the pubs, but during the day it's a fascinating area to explore.

## Princes Avenue and The Avenues: Bohemian and Victorian

Princes Avenue and the surrounding Avenues area represent Hull's bohemian heart and Victorian elegance. This is where you'll find independent shops, diverse restaurants, and a community that values creativity and individuality.

**Character and Atmosphere**

Princes Avenue itself is a broad, tree-lined street with a continental feel. Cafes and restaurants have outdoor seating, creating a European cafe culture atmosphere on sunny days. The street attracts a diverse crowd—students, young professionals, families, artists—creating a vibrant, tolerant community.

The Avenues (Chanterlands Avenue, Westbourne Avenue, Park Avenue, and Victoria Avenue) branch off Princes Avenue, lined with Victorian terraced houses. These streets are beautiful, with mature trees and well-maintained properties creating an elegant residential environment.

**What You'll Find**

**Restaurants and Cafes:** Princes Avenue is Hull's restaurant row. You'll find Italian at Ambiente, Middle Eastern at Furley & Co, cafes like Brew, and numerous other options covering diverse cuisines. The quality is generally high, and the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming.

**Independent Shops:** Quirky boutiques, vintage stores, and specialist shops line Princes Avenue and nearby streets. These aren't chain stores—they're independent businesses run by people passionate about what they sell.

**Pearson Park:** At the western end of Princes Avenue sits Pearson Park, a Victorian park with a lake, gardens, and the beautiful Pearson Park Conservatory. It's a peaceful green space perfect for walks or picnics.

**Community Feel:** The Avenues has a strong community identity. Residents take pride in their neighborhood, organizing events and supporting local businesses. There's a neighborhood association, community gardens, and a genuine sense of people looking out for each other.

## The Marina and Fruit Market: Waterfront Living

The Marina and adjacent Fruit Market area represent Hull's contemporary face—waterfront development, creative industries, and modern living in converted warehouses and new builds.

**Character and Atmosphere**

The Marina is exactly what it sounds like—a working marina with hundreds of boats, surrounded by apartments, restaurants, and bars. The waterfront location creates an attractive environment, particularly on sunny days when the outdoor seating fills and the water sparkles.

The Fruit Market, once a working wholesale market, has transformed into Hull's creative quarter. Converted warehouses house artists' studios, galleries, cafes, and creative businesses. The industrial architecture provides character, while new uses bring vitality.

**What You'll Find**

**Restaurants and Bars:** The Marina is Hull's premier dining destination. Waterfront restaurants like 1884 Dock Street Kitchen and Ambiente Tapas offer quality food with views. Bars and pubs provide drinks with a waterfront atmosphere.

**Humber Street Gallery:** This contemporary art gallery showcases changing exhibitions in a converted warehouse. Admission is free, and the cafe provides a pleasant spot to relax.

**The Deep:** While technically just outside the Marina proper, The Deep aquarium is a short walk away and a major attraction.

**Creative Businesses:** The Fruit Market houses artists' studios, design agencies, and creative businesses. Some studios open to the public during events, offering glimpses into working creative spaces.

**Modern Living:** The Marina and Fruit Market have attracted significant residential development, with converted warehouses and new apartment buildings providing modern waterfront living.

**Verdict:** The Marina and Fruit Market are ideal for those seeking waterfront atmosphere, contemporary culture, and quality dining. It's Hull's most obviously attractive area, though it can feel somewhat removed from the rest of the city.

## Hessle Road: Working-Class Heritage

Hessle Road carries deep significance in Hull's history and identity. This was the heart of Hull's fishing community, where trawlermen and their families lived. The fishing industry's decline hit Hessle Road hard, but the area retains strong community identity and is experiencing gradual regeneration.

**Character and Atmosphere**

Hessle Road is unpolished and unpretentious, a working-class neighborhood that hasn't been gentrified or sanitized. The street itself is long and somewhat run-down, with a mix of shops, takeaways, and services. But beneath the surface is a community with deep roots and strong identity.

**What You'll Find**

**Fish and Chips:** Hessle Road is home to some of Hull's best fish and chip shops, including the legendary Holtby's. Given the area's fishing heritage, this is appropriate.

**Community Spirit:** Despite economic challenges, Hessle Road maintains strong community bonds. The Hessle Road Network works to preserve the area's heritage and support the community.

**Hull's Fishing Heritage Centre:** This museum tells the story of Hull's fishing industry and the Hessle Road community. It's moving and important, documenting a way of life that has largely disappeared.

**Verdict:** Hessle Road isn't a tourist destination in the conventional sense, but it's important to understanding Hull. The fishing heritage, community spirit, and working-class culture are essential parts of Hull's identity.

## Newland Avenue: Student Quarter and Independent Shops

Newland Avenue continues where Princes Avenue leaves off, extending westward toward the university. It's a vibrant street with a student influence, independent shops, and a relaxed, slightly bohemian atmosphere.

**Character and Atmosphere**

Newland Avenue has a younger, more student-oriented vibe than Princes Avenue. It's slightly scruffier, more relaxed, with cheaper eats and a more casual atmosphere. The proximity to the university means a constant flow of students, giving the area youthful energy.

**What You'll Find**

**Independent Shops:** Vintage stores, record shops, bookshops, and quirky boutiques line Newland Avenue. These are the kind of shops where you browse for hours and discover unexpected treasures.

**Cafes and Restaurants:** Options range from cheap student-friendly eats to quality restaurants. Caffeinated cafe is a neighborhood favorite, serving excellent coffee and food all day.

**Community Hub:** Newland Avenue has a strong community identity, with local businesses supporting each other and residents taking pride in their neighborhood.

**Verdict:** Newland Avenue is perfect for those seeking independent shops, affordable eats, and a relaxed, bohemian atmosphere. It's less polished than Princes Avenue but has its own charm.
