# UI Redesign Research - Leading Tourism Websites

## Airbnb UX Design Principles

### Key Takeaways from Airbnb's Success:

1. **User-Centered Approach**: Focus on user problems and pain points, not just sales
2. **Iterative Design**: Continuous improvement rather than trying to perfect everything at once
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear focus on what matters most (search, destinations, CTAs)
4. **Credibility**: Use logos, reviews, and social proof to build trust
5. **Typography**: Stick to 1-2 sans-serif fonts throughout for consistency
6. **Grid Layout**: Responsive design with consistent spacing
7. **Actionable Design**: Clear CTAs and easy navigation
8. **Price Transparency**: Prices are clear and at the forefront
9. **Minimalism**: Simplified designs that let content breathe

### Design Evolution Patterns:

**Mobile App (2012):**

- Clear price tags and CTAs
- Bold, actionable buttons
- Solid hierarchy
- Easy navigation
- Realistic button designs (skeuomorphic for the time)
