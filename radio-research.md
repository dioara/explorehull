# Hull Radio Station Research

## BBC Radio Humberside
- **Status**: BBC does NOT allow free embedding of live radio streams
- **Restrictions**: BBC Sounds and BBC Radio streams are only available through official BBC apps and website
- **Embed Policy**: BBC only allows embedding of specific news video content, not live radio
- **Alternative**: Can only link to BBC Sounds page, cannot embed player

## Viking FM (Hits Radio East Yorkshire)
- **Frequency**: 96.9 FM
- **Coverage**: Hull and Humberside
- **Owner**: Bauer Radio Ltd (part of Hits Radio network)
- **Status**: Need to check if they offer embeddable player

## Conclusion
BBC Radio Humberside cannot be embedded due to BBC's strict embedding policies. Will need to check third-party radio aggregators or Viking FM directly for embeddable options.

## Alternative Approach
Since major Hull radio stations don't offer free embeddable players without contracts:
1. Add a "Listen to Hull Radio" section with links to stations
2. Use a simple radio directory widget that links to external players
3. Focus on improving other aspects of the site instead
